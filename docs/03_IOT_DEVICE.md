# AWS IoT Device for Sleep Science Q-Plus Adjustable Base

In this section we'll create an [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) thing used to control the bed using [Thing Shadows](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-shadows.html). The overall IoT workflow is illusrated in the diagram below from AWS:

Shadows are are useful concept in the world of IoT for asynchronous device control usign standard protocols like MQTT and Websockets. Shadows contain the `state` for a thing and have two important fields, `desired` and `reported`. When the `desired` state is updated from an Lambda function the `delta` is published to he MQTT topic, the device listening on that topic sees the delta and tries to resolve it. Once resolved, the device sets the `reported` state of the shadow and the state is now back in sync.

## Creating the device

Set environment variables:

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
export IOT_ENDPOINT=$(aws iot describe-endpoint | jq -r '.endpointAddress')
export THING_NAME=iot-bed
```

Create the certificates:

```
CERT_ARN=$(aws iot create-keys-and-certificate \
  --set-as-active \
  --certificate-pem-outfile device.pem \
  --public-key-outfile device.pub \
  --private-key-outfile device-key.pem | jq -r '.certificateArn')
```

Create the IoT Thing:

```
THING_ARN=$(aws iot create-thing \
  --thing-name "${THING_NAME}" | jq -r '.thingArn')
```

Connect certificate to thing:

```
aws iot attach-thing-principal \
  --thing-name "${THING_NAME}" \
  --principal "${CERT_ARN}"
```

Create the policy:

```
aws iot create-policy \
  --policy-name "${THING_NAME}" \
  --policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Action":"iot:*","Resource":"*","Effect":"Allow"}]}'
```

Attach the policy:

```
aws iot attach-principal-policy \
  --principal "${CERT_ARN}" \
  --policy-name "${THING_NAME}"
```

Download the root cert:

```
curl -o root-CA.crt https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem
```

To get the current shadow state:

```
aws iot-data get-thing-shadow \
  --thing-name iot-bed /dev/stdout | jq .
```

The code that connects to this shadow is in the [`src/iot`](../src/iot) directory.

Next we create a [Lambda function that will update the thing shadow.](./04_LAMBDA.md)
